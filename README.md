# Personal-Ticket-System
The Personal Ticket System is a lightweight web application designed to help me manage tasks and requests more effectively. Instead of keeping tasks in my head, every task is recorded as a ticket that can be created, updated, and closed.

This project is built as both:

A personal productivity tool
A software engineering learning project focusing on planning, documentation, and clean implementation

🎯 Problem Statement

I often feel overwhelmed by tasks and requests because:

Tasks are easy to forget

Requests accumulate over time

Free time becomes unproductive due to lack of clarity

Progress is hard to measure

This system solves that by introducing a structured workflow similar to real-world issue tracking systems.

💡 Solution

The application uses a ticket-based workflow:

Create a ticket for every task or request

Track active tickets

Update tickets as work progresses

Close tickets when completed

Review completed tickets to measure productivity

🧱 Features (MVP)

Create a ticket with:

Title

Description

Priority level

Due date
